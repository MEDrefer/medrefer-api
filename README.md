medrefer-api
============

The MEDrefer API allows medical applications to issue and/or accept referral letters, check their status and send reports back to the referring provider.

All requests are transmitted via HTTPS.

The API is REST based, and returns JSON (or optionally XML) in its responses.

This allows any HTTP client to interact with the MEDrefer application.
